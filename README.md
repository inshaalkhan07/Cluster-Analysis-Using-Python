# Clustering-Analysis-using-Python

• Conducted data cleansing, standardization, and feature transformation on both 3D and 2D financial datasets comprising over 7500 records, to prepare the data for subsequent clustering analysis.

• Utilized K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering techniques, visualizing results through Scatter plots and Dendrograms for comprehensive representation.

• Evaluated algorithm performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.84 and a silhouette ratio of 0.76, resulting in meaningful clusters and valuable insights from financial data analysis.
